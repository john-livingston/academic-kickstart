John Livingston is an astronomer at the University of Tokyo. He researches exoplanets,
starting wth their discovery via the transit method using data from
space-based missions like Kepler, K2, and TESS. He conducts follow-up 
transit observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope and
high-precision ground-based instruments, which help to confirm their
planetary nature and refine estimates of their radii and orbital periods. 
He also uses stabilized high-precision spectrographs to measure their masses via the 
radial velocity method, which constrains planetary mean density, bulk composition,
and orbital dynamics.
